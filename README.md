Vincent Radio {Adrix.NT} :: PHP :: Guess a Number in range

this is a small PHP Guess Number applet that lets the user ...
- set the max number to guess (starting from 0)
- play the game

the number of tries left to the user is based upon the max number

it also shows ...
- the number of tries left
- the previous guesses

it is made up of 1 PHP + HTML file (you can find it into the zipped file)
